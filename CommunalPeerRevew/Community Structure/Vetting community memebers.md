# Vetting community members

A community member may achieve #vetted status by accumulating #clout in various ways:

- Previously published papers 
- Contributions to the review of a given paper
- Probably other stuff too 

Once some `critical threshold`  of accumulated #clout is reached, a member is considered #vetted, and may begin to accrue #stake in the [[communually owned endowment]] by contrinuting to the Community Review process 

The status of being #vetted is a binary - a member is either #vetted or #non-vetted. However, there is no limit to the amount of #clout that a member may earn, which will allow them to receive some degree of prestige and recognition for their contributions to the community at large.
