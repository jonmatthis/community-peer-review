- Payments into this endowment fund can come from - 
	- **Article processing fees paid by submitting authors**
		- When possible these will be written in to grants and other funding mechanisms (similar to traditional journal fees )
		- Unfunded, or underfunded researchers may apply for waivers on these fees
		- If possible, author fees will cover MORE than the cost of processing an article (say, double)
			- Authors will retain 'ownership' of the excess funding, but will be strongly incentivised from withdrawing in the form of steep penalties for early withdrawl that diminish according to a 'vesting' schedule 
				- after the end of the vesting schedule, the authors will retain ownership of those funds accoring the standard 'staking' mechanism defined in the [[Incentive structure]]
	- **Grants and other external funding**
		- Submission of grants to various "metascience" mechanisms and solicited donations from philantropic organizations (similar to how eLife got it's start)
	- **Annual meetings?**
	- **I don't know, like... Merch? lol**
